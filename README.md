# Cadastre

The idea of Cadastre is to make a visualizaton of tilde.town by letting all users make their own ascii art home and stitch this together.

Usage instructions can be found on http://tilde.town/~troido/cadastre

A map of the current tilde.town cadastre can be found here: http://tilde.town/~troido/cadastre/town.html

The raw data of the tilde.town cadastre can be found here: http://tilde.town/~troido/cadastre/town.json

## Program

This program is meant to run from a cron job to periodically scrape all user directories

## Known bugs

I still have to escape any special characters in the urls.
Currenty a stray " could break the image.
At the moment I don't have internet access, but when I have I'll look up how to do this securely
