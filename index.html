<h1>Tilde Town Cadastre</h1>
<p>
View the town map here: <a href="town.html">town.html</a><br />
You can also use the <a href="town.json">JSON data</a> to make your own viewer.
</p>
<p>
The source code can be found on github: <a href="https://github.com/jmdejong/cadastre">github.com/jmdejong/cadastre</a>
</p>
<p>
The idea of Cadastre is to make a visualizaton of tilde.town by letting all users make their own ascii art home and stitch this together.
</p>
<p>
All tilde.town users can claim a parcel of 24 by 12 characters.
This is then placed in the town map at the place the users claimed (if this place is free).
The town map is updated every minute.
</p>
<h2>How to claim a parcel</h2>
<p>
To claim your own piece of land, create a folder in your home directory called '.cadastre'.
In this folder, create a file called 'home.txt'.<br />
The first line of home.txt should contain two space-separated positive integers.
The next 12 lines should contain your ascii art.<br />
The lines should be 24 characters long.
Longer lines will be cropped, shorter lines will be padded with spaces.<br />
Only printable ascii characters may be used.
Other characters (including tabs and newlines) will be replaced with spaces.
</p>
<p>
If your home.txt is not correct, or if the place you are trying to claim is claimed already, your home will be ignored.<br />
You could look in <a href="http://tilde.town/~troido/cadastre.log">cadastre.log</a> to get an idea what happened
</p>
<p>
An example for ~/.cadastre/home.txt:
<pre>
0 1
+==()=================+.
| (%&8)  /\       _,__|.
|(&(%)%)/  \    . __,_|.
| (%8%)/_##_\   .     |.
|  ||/ |    |   . @   |.
|  ||  | /\ | * . @   |.
|  ||  |_||_|   .     |.
|        ..  *  .     |.
| (%) O  ........     |.
|        ..    ~troido|.
+=======#  #==========+.
........................
</pre>
</p>
<h2>How to link to some page</h2>
<p>
You can link to any page, letting the user enter your house/cave/whatever.<br >
To do this, leave one line empty after your ascii art image.
Then, create another 24 by 12 image. Each of the characters in the image corresponds to a link.
After that, create a line per link.
These lines should consist of 1 character from your second drawing, followed by a space, followed by a url.
</p>
<p>
It is probably easier to understand if I give an example:
<pre>
0 1
+==()=================+.
| (%&8)  /\       _,__|.
|(&(%)%)/  \    . __,_|.
| (%8%)/_##_\   .     |.
|  ||/ |    |   . @   |.
|  ||  | /\ | * . @   |.
|  ||  |_||_|   .     |.
|        ..  *  .     |.
| (%) O  ........     |.
|        ..    ~troido|.
+=======#  #==========+.

</pre>
Each place where there is a comma in the second drawing will now link to http://tilde.town/~troido/cadastre/town.html<br />
Each place where there is an H will link to http://tilde.town/~troido/index.html<br />
The other places aren't links
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to leave out the second drawing, and have all characters from the first drawing directly correspond to the link.<br />
To do so, put a minus sign in the line after the first drawing (that should otherwise be empty.<br />
For example:
<pre>
5 1
####################
#  ____            #
# / \__\           #
# |_|__|    ,,,,,  #
#           ,,,,,  #
#    -----  ,,,,,  #
#    -----     _   #
#    -----    (*)  #
# ~johndoe     |   #
##########(%)#######

Now only the fence will link to https://example.com

<h2>Other tips</h2>
<p>
If you have a parcel and claim another parcel, you old parcel will become free to claim again.
However, until anyone has done so, or I reset the unclaimed parts, your art will stay there.
</p>
<p>
You can set up a cron job to automatically let your parcel change throughout the day
</p>
<p>
You can leave any suggestions in the publicly editable suggestions.txt, or you can mail them to me, or mention them on github.
