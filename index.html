<h1>Tilde Town Cadastre</h1>
<p>
View the town map here: <a href="town.html">town.html</a><br />
You can also use the <a href="town.json">JSON data</a> to make your own viewer.
</p>
<p>
The source code can be found on github: <a href="https://github.com/jmdejong/cadastre">github.com/jmdejong/cadastre</a>
</p>
<p>
The idea of Cadastre is to make a visualizaton of tilde.town by letting all users make their own ascii art home and stitch this together.
</p>
<p>
All tilde.town users can claim a parcel of 24 by 12 characters.
This is then placed in the town map at the place the users claimed (if this place is free).<br />
In addition to users own parcels, it is possible to make public parcels.
Parcels belonging to users can override public parcels.
</p>
<p>
The town map is updated every minute.
</p>
<h2>How to claim a parcel</h2>
<p>
To claim your own piece of land, create a folder in your home directory called '.cadastre'.
In this folder, create a file called 'home.txt'.<br />
The first line of home.txt should contain two space-separated positive integers.
This will be the coordinates of your parcel (first horizontal then vertical; coordinates start at 0)<br />
Your x coodinates must be larger than or equal to 0 and smaller than 25 to show up in the normal viewer.<br />
The next 12 lines should contain your ascii art.<br />
The lines should be 24 characters long.
Longer lines will be cropped, shorter lines will be padded with spaces.<br />
Only printable ascii characters may be used.
Other characters (including tabs and newlines) will be replaced with spaces.
</p>
<p>
If your home.txt is not correct, or if the place you are trying to claim is claimed already, your home will be ignored.<br />
You could look in <a href="https://tilde.town/~troido/cadastre.log">cadastre.log</a> to get an idea what happened
</p>
<p>
An example for ~/.cadastre/home.txt:
<pre>
0 1
+==()=================+.
| (%&8)  /\       _,__|.
|(&(%)%)/  \    . __,_|.
| (%8%)/_##_\   .     |.
|  ||/ |    |   . @   |.
|  ||  | /\ | * . @   |.
|  ||  |_||_|   .     |.
|        ..  *  .     |.
| (%) O  ........     |.
|        ..    ~troido|.
+=======#  #==========+.
........................
</pre>
</p>
<h3>How to link to some page</h3>
<p>
You can link to any page, letting the user enter your house/cave/whatever.<br >
To do this, leave one line empty after your ascii art image.
Then, create another 24 by 12 image. Each of the characters in the image corresponds to a link.
After that, create a line per link.
These lines should consist of 1 character from your second drawing, followed by a space, followed by a url.
</p>
<p>
It is probably easier to understand if I give an example:
<pre>
0 1
+==()=================+.
| (%&8)  /\       _,__|.
|(&(%)%)/  \    . __,_|.
| (%8%)/_##_\   .     |.
|  ||/ |    |   . @   |.
|  ||  | /\ | * . @   |.
|  ||  |_||_|   .     |.
|        ..  *  .     |.
| (%) O  ........     |.
|        ..    ~troido|.
+=======#  #==========+.

Each place where there is a 2 in the second drawing will now link to https://tilde.town/~troido/cadastre/town.html<br />
Each place where there is an 1 will link to https://tilde.town/~troido/index.html<br />
The other places aren't links
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to leave out the second drawing, and have all characters from the first drawing directly correspond to the link.<br />
To do so, put a minus sign in the line after the first drawing (that should otherwise be empty.<br />
For example:
<pre>
5 1
####################
#  ____            #
# / \__\           #
# |_|__|    ,,,,,  #
#           ,,,,,  #
#    -----  ,,,,,  #
#    -----     _   #
#    -----    (*)  #
# ~johndoe     |   #
##########(%)#######
...........|........

# https://example.com
</pre>
Now only the fence will link to https://example.com

<h2>Public parcels</h2>
It is possible create public parcels by making text files in the ~troido/cadastre/public folder.
Any file in this folder ending in '.prcl' will be seen as a parcel. This used to be '.txt', but that has changed.<br />
Public parcels can be edited by anyone.<br />
A public parcel can use some land, but does not really 'claim' it.
The data can be overwritten, and other users can still claim the place.
</p>
<p>
Please use public parcels for something of the whole community, not an extension of your home.
</p>
<p>
It is ok to have public parcels generated by scripts, with two conditions:
<ul>
<li>Put the script in the same folder</li>
<li>Make sure that it's clear from the filename that a parcel is scriped and which script belongs to which parcel.<br />
For example, if you have a park with moving animals, name the parcel 'park_scripted.prcl' and name the script to change it 'park_script.py"
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Other tips</h2>
<p>
You can set up a cron job to automatically let your parcel change throughout the day
</p>
<h2>Development and Support</h2>
<p>
I'm not really sure how to continue with this project, so I would love to hear other people's ideas.
</p>
<p>
I have made a BBJ thread about cadastre.
You can leave any questions/suggestions/feedback there.
</p>
</p>
Alternatively you can also email me (internal mail), tell me in irc or put a comment/issue on github.
